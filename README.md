# cat-dog-classifier
A CNN based Deep Learning model which takes an image as input and classifies it as a dog or cat image

In this model i have used 5 Convo2D(CNN) layers where each layer is followed by one max pooling layer.
Dropout layers have also been added to the model

At last one Dense layer(Neural Network) had been added which finally gives us the output whether the input image is a dog or a cat image.
